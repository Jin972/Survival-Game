# Introduction
Hi, I'm Jin, a future game developer, and owner of this project. This is my first game project with apocalyptic themes, it is also based on my favorite game Last Day on Earth. Players will explore the post-apocalyptic world with a third-person perspective, a world where civilization is almost destroyed. They will face dangers from zombies and hunger, so players will have to constantly collect food, drink, weapons, and many other necessary items to fight the dangers lurking. Equipment will make the player stronger, the assembly system helps the player to create the necessary items and shelter is needed to protect them and other functions are waiting for the player to discover.
